		<p class="big"> Hello, I'm Justin Hartman! This website encapsulates who I am and where I'm at with my life academically and professionally. 
I'm currently a senior at the University of South Florida earning my Bachelors degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems.
I graduate in early December and plan on starting my Masters degree in Data Analytics in the Fall of 2020. As you can see from my
website, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-hartman-498a74155/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JustinHartman407">GitHub</a>, I have completed many projects while here at USF. Some of these 
projects I have worked include SQL Database/Data Mart Designs, C#, Python, and HTML. I also currently work as a Global Systems Administrator
for Nielsen, specifically in Account Management. During my time at Nielsen I have set up 1000's of accounts and aided key account clients.
I'm also the current Treasurer of the Sigma Pi Fraternity here at USF and manage a budget of around $26,000. For fun, I like to play Ultimate Frisbee,
watch football (Go Colts!), and learn new things. Hopefully, this website gives you the chance to get to know a little bit more about me, and of course thank you for your time. Please contact 
me by following the contact link at the top of the page.</p>
